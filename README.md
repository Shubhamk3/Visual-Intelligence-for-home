# Visual-Intelligence-for-home
An open source Hardware project which will assist you daily using ML and AI

It's been ages since the launch of ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok etc. and most of it are used by the Programmers. So I have decided to make a project which includes some hardwares and can be used in our day to day lives.

Objective:

Needful:
Microprocessor - FS32V234CON2VUB:
Quad Cortex-A53 cores running up to 1GHz,
Dual APEX-2 vision accelerator cores
MIPI CSI2 and parallel image sensor interfaces
Embedded image sensor processing (ISP) for HDR, color conversion, tone mapping, etc
3D GPU (GC3000)

Camera - IMX219PQH5-C 

IMU Sensor for motion/gesture - MPU6050, BNO055

Edge AI accelerator(Optional) - Google Coral, Hailo-8

Microphone array - INMP441

Ethernet
Wifi
ROM
RTC
Temp and humidity sensor
touch display
